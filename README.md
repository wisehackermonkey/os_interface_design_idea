# os_interface_design_idea
my thoughts on os visual interface metaphors, and shapes 


Interface Design os and webapp

idea
when hovering over a folder 
it shows a preview of the file's contents
like rending of small thumbnails in a grid or in folder form

adendum 
when when preview hover is shown if the user clicks on one of the icons with the hover it displays recursivly the contents of the file

idea 
semantics note
change wording of windows gb free status
from 86.4 GB free of 222 GB
to   out of 222 GB only 86.4 empty

idea 
semantics note
give meaning full names to 
hardrives
from 
Local Disk (D:)
to
File Storage Device #1 On port 5
Note enable hardware mapping of names to drives give os view of port number to drive location on os

idea 
v1 create a hard drive icon that 
fills up visually to convay space left empty

v2 use the hard drive logo as a way to convay hard drive capacity by creating a bargraph out of the logos body. 

idea
create a desktop that has a feature that what you put
right infront of you will be stored in ram. 
like if you spread objects out on a desk. There is no difference in how long it takes you to grab any of the times

idea
create a random access data structure.
like an array but for userdata stored in memory. like ram disk but not trying to be a hard drive simulator

idea
how to convay idea that an object(data in case the OS) is physically on another desktop

virticaly separate the visual space into two equal sections. the user can drag files from one desktop to the other by moving the  objects from one side to another.

Idea
on a study desk people use small strips of paper in the path sight to remind them of import  ideas
 or tasks

what is also stored in locations where the persons eyes fallow often are 
tools used frequently

logic Reminder /= Tools

Idea
tool bars are like having figuriens on the desk's shelf.
i find this visually cluttering.
no unfunctional objects on desk shelf.(desk shelf is the visual bar below application title and begining of useable space

idea
theme the bounding window to look like a folder or a picture frame when opening content that would physically look like the data 

v2
when opening a object on the os
theme the bounding window boarder to look like a folder or picture frame

Idea
visual semantics
replace the visual consept of a 'folder' with icon of a Box or cheast.

box
- pros. boxes can contains objects of differing types

- pro you can see the items at the top of the box

- pro when a folder is empty
the box shows a empty box

- zip file consept  is a closed box 

- zip file if locked show key symbol to signify password protected

adendum
Call them Bloxese sence they look like cubes and stack like in minecraft  and recursivly nest.

v1 when you physicaly grab a box
you cant get a the stuff at the bottom with out moving stuff out of the way

v2 to access items from the bottom of a physical box it is required to first remove the other items to get to the items further down inside

Idea

Using Bloxese visual analogy
create virtical stacks of thumb nails that show a condensed view of whats inside the box

right clicking allows you to lift the stack and thumb through it.

Idea
thought
visually separate the iconigraphic 
analogy for folders from the icon idea for items.

v2 
create visually separet icons to deferensheate idea of item vs item container(Folder aka box)

solution
let icons be 3d looking and have them look like physical items in side a box. dont allow for users to create item with same shape

Idea

problem 
lots of thumbnails photos take up to much 
v2 
large numbers of photo thumbnails
take up too much visual space.
condense them by using idea of 5 x 4in photo prints like the side of a book or stack of cards
but
